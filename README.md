# Project 3 - *Yelp*

**Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height. (3pt)
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints. (+5pt)
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does). (+2pt)

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page. (+2pt)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. expandable cells to view more information instead of navigating to a new view
2. using filters to narrow search results

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

The functions for searching were separated into a different class and used differently compared to previous lessons. It took some time to correctly use the API and get the desired information.

There was also a part in the walkthrough that used an url to set the image for the rating. This did not reflect what was in the starter files, so it took some time to figure how to correctly set the image. In fact, I had an easier time figuring it out after taking a break from the night session at CodePath.
